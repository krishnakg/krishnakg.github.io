I use a selfhosted [[https://freshrss.org/index.html][FreshRSS]] instance to manage my rss feeds. I wanted a quick way to add a web page's rss feed into FreshRSS without copy pasting the URLs. So i created a bookmarklet with the following code to open the freshRSS add-feed page with the URL filled in.

#+begin_src javascript
javascript:(function(){
  var freshRssUrl = 'https://[FreshRSS_Domain_URL]/i/?c=feed&a=add&url_rss=';
  window.open(freshRssUrl + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));
})()
#+end_src

Of course, update the URL to your FreshRSS domain accordingly in that snippet!

Another quick tip: Did you know that all Youtube channels have a rss feed? I use these rss feeds to get notifications for any new youtube videos on my favorite channels.
